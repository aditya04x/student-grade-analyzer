# 📄 Project Statement – Student Grade Analyzer

## 1. Problem Statement
Analyzing students’ academic performance manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers or evaluators often deal with multiple student marks and need a quick way to understand statistical performance, identify top performers, weak students, and overall class strength. A Python-based automated solution is required to simplify this process.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project includes:
- Loading marks through a CSV file or manual input  
- Computing detailed statistical metrics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)  
- Performing performance analysis (pass percentage, top performers, weak performers)  
- Generating a structured JSON report  
- Logging actions and errors  

The project focuses on analysis only and does not include GUI, databases, or authentication features.

## 3. Target Users
- Teachers & faculty members  
- Students analyzing their class performance  
- Educational institutions  
- Anyone learning Python & data handling  

## 4. High-Level Features

### 🔹 Input Handling
- Load marks from CSV  
- Manual marks entry via CLI  

### 🔹 Statistical Calculations
- Automated computation of multiple statistical measures  

### 🔹 Performance Insights
- Identify top 3 and weak 3 students  
- Calculate pass/fail and percentages  

### 🔹 Report Generation
- JSON report containing full analysis  
- Log file maintaining events/errors  

These features align perfectly with the Python programming course requirements for modularity, file handling, and logic-based development.
